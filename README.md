# Mining a Bank Telemarketing Dataset

The project was done by four students of the MS Information Systems program at the University of Cincinati for the course 'Advanced Business Intelligence'. Each one of us was responsible for a certain number of aspects, I was responsible for the following:

* Creation of model comparison criteria 
* Using the SPSS Modeler to model the dataset using a Support Vector Machine algorithm and finding the right function (Radial Basis).
* Final comparison of the different learning models created by the other three members

More specifically, the sections from the report I wrote were:

* Section 1: Introduction
* Section 2: Background
* Section 3: Problem Analysis and Design
* Section 5.2: Support Vector Machines
* Section 6: Discussion

Attached are the SPSS stream file created and a draft version of the final report.
