# Mining a Bank Telemarketing Dataset

The project was done by four students of the MS Information Systems program at the University of Cincinati for the course Advanced Business Intelligence. Each one of us was responsible for a certain number of aspects, I was responsible for the following:

* Creation of model comparision criteria 
* Modeling in SPSS Modeler using a Radial Basis Function of a Support Vector Machine algorithm
* Final comparison of different learning models

More specifically, the sections from the report I wrote were:

* Section 1 Introduction
* Section 2 Background
* Section 3 Problem Analysis and Design
* Section 5.2 Support Vector Machines
* Section 5 Discussion
